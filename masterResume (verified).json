Lightbox JS helped me overlay images using modals and CSS Positioning for the gallery. The most challenging feature was the banner slideshow since I used keyframes and overlays to compose an astonishing after trial and error.",

Furthermore, the floating player made the main feature: whenever you'd ready, the routine would start running and time every activity until completion.",

Again, I separated styling concerns by CSS files but the sections; now, with comments and clever class names, we had less complex, maintainable style sheets. For layout purposes, I only used Normalize CSS and Bootstrap's Grid to adjust every component's size and position for each Media Query. To display our HD mockups, I used Lightbox again within a slideshow. On the other hand, contact forms sent our prospects' inquiries to a Node.js/Express.js/MongoDB server; this time, we received messages in our e-mail thanks to nodemail and our paid mailing service.",

I decomposed my templates into these HTML elements: \"models\" (the general order of the primary areas in a page), sections, and components; additionally, I could upload CSS files containing layout designs, color palettes, and font pairings. For each element, I could choose the HTML tag and categorize them. Every \"model\" worked as a template and allowed me to populate with content later.",

The first server loaded React and rendered the source components into an event-reactive UI; meanwhile, the second one served the API, established the routes, and put the controllers to execute operations on the MongoDB database. With the multer middleware, the back-end server stored and associated my CSS files with HTML elements. Finally, I could browse my templates and render them in different tabs. Would I change a piece of TUNA? All of it."

			"description": "The Rodriguez Nursery's website by Lifether",
			"highlights": [
				"The Rodriguez family has owned a local nursery for decades, giving their customers quality products and service; Lifether reflected that in their first online store to appeal to that entrepreneurial thinking. The site served as a landing page and a sales channel so customers could browse, share, and purchase their favorite sprouts. Growing the customer base became an important milestone, so the Lifether team connected the Rodriguez and valley communities by running social media campaigns.",
				"The site included a hero banner, Lightbox galleries, clever statistics, social media engagement, testimonials from frequent customers, contact information and location widgets with Google Maps, and strategic CTAs along with the site. The CTAs led to a Shopify store where customers could order plants instantly. In Shopify, we maintained e-commerce dashboards and reporting tools to enhance financial control and customer experience through data visualization.",
				"We used multiple CSS Modules (like keyframes for animations, Flexbox, positioning, and Media Queries for responsiveness) and JavaScript to make a vivid UX artwork. Technologies involved in design and development were Figma (UI mockup), Sass (CSS pre-processor), and multiple JS front-end libraries (Bootstrap, Lightbox, jQuery, Owl Carousel, Popper, and Slick)."

			"highlights": [
				"Based on previous solutions, I debuted as a back-end developer with a bulk E-commerce processor with Node.js to grab products from Amazon and republish them in Mercado Libre, a Latin American marketplace. By interchanging tokens and keys, I used existing APIs from web scrappers for data gathering and integration.",
				"The web API development lacked UI but, in turn, used GraphQL to interact with data. I did API integration on top of a layer/microservices architecture organized by routes, middleware, independent services, and Database I/O models. Additionally, each service could schedule jobs and trigger events to communicate with other services; that's how I managed to scan the Amazon store x times per day and update a product's information according to stock (scheduled data collection).",
				"I built the server with TypeScript and used Agenda (job scheduling), Axios, Celebrate.js (request validation), and JSONWebToken (for user authentication and authorization). The core services consumed most of these resources using Typedi for Dependency Injection (a recommended programming practice in OOP). I did an issue investigation by using Mercado Libre's SDK. PS I also have video tutorials for AMLApp."

			"highlights": [
				"Hitzii was an approach for remote team collaboration and data sharing plus a customizable set of tools and cloud applications. The app offered instant chat and privilege-managed file storage shared within an organization; the group had access to a virtual workspace with task boards and storage folders to comment and modify in real-time. Additionally, Hitzii offered troubleshooting for technical needs regarding the app.",
				"Reapplying some of the learned principles from previous back-end projects, as Hitzii's CEO and Web Architect, I built a robust, clean code Node.js infrastructure with powerful features. We implemented job scheduling, event-driven pipelines, and dependency injection again, plus error logging to strengthen system performance with bug fixes. I wrote the technical product specification and led the documentation, so devs and designers fed on a single source of truth. I taught the team to write and interpret Class Diagrams, OMTs (Object-Modeling Technique), and flowcharts to visualize static and dynamic components; product management ensured cross-functional collaboration.",
				"We used dozen of tools, programs, libraries, dependencies, and frameworks to bring Hitzii's first MVP alive. Some of them were Typora (for diagrams), Figma, Trello + Slack (for team collaboration), Node.js + Express, MongoDB + Redis (as NoSQL databases), REST and WebSockets (for data transmission). For DevOps, we used AWS products."

			"highlights": [
				"TTZ is a single-page web application to handle time notions around the world. As a user or a guest, everyone can create synchronized clocks with timezones from anywhere worldwide (yes, like a train station lobby). On one side panel, users can add contacts along with timezone-adjusted watches; on the other one, they have an event list that triggers an alarm besides displaying the offset time and a list of members. Each clock supports timezone changes everywhere, including summer and winter time.",
				"Tiny-Timezones components work with ReactJS, with loads in the DOM in its minified version followed by Moment.js (for timezones data and functions), qs.js, and UUID. For the server, I used PostgreSQL and Sequelize ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) as database and dependency, respectively. TTZ loads its views with Pug.js and allows instant OAuth-based access through Google.",
				"After problem identification, I researched and resolved common problems among remote teams: time zone coordination, applying reactive programming, and browser testing made TTZ a cross-mobile, cross-browser solution with adaptability."

The logic behind the form-to-database flow worked thanks to a Node.js server and a MongoDB cluster; this site's source code version doesn't receive messages anymore.",
				"Through my first two years of freelance services, I made tens of budget quotes and timeframes--only a couple of them led a project, though. Besides sales funnels, mockups, and CMSs, I began implementing back-end services like APIs, web scrappers, and e-commerce platforms. With Web Security as a priority, I professionally handled user credentials and payment processors."
